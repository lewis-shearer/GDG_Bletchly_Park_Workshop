# GDG DevFest 2025 Workshop: Building a CNN Model to Detect Early Signs of Brain Cancer

## Overview
Welcome to the GDG DevFest 2025 workshop at Bletchley Park! In this hands-on session, you'll learn how to build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to detect early signs of brain cancer from medical imaging data.

Please note that **this project is not a medical tool** and should **not** be used for actual medical diagnosis. The goal is to demonstrate how machine learning techniques, specifically CNNs, can be applied to medical image analysis.

## Disclaimer
This project and workshop are for educational purposes only. The model we build is a simplified example for learning how to apply deep learning to image data. It is **not intended for actual clinical use** and **should not be used for diagnosing or making healthcare decisions**. Always consult healthcare professionals for medical advice.

## Prerequisites
To follow along with this workshop, you'll need access to the following:

- A **Google account** (for using Google Colab).
- Basic understanding of **Python** and **machine learning**.
- Familiarity with **Google Colab** or similar notebook environments.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**: Start by cloning this repository to your Google Colab environment.

    - Copy the link to the GitHub repository:  
      [GDG Bletchley Park Workshop Repo](https://github.com/lewis-shearer/GDG_Bletchly_Park_Workshop)
      
    - In Google Colab, go to **File > Open notebook** and select the **GitHub** tab.
    - Paste the GitHub repository link into the search bar and select the notebook you want to open.

2. **Run the setup blocks**:
   Once the notebook is open in Google Colab, follow the steps below:

    - **Block 1: Install Dependencies**
      This will install all the required libraries and tools necessary for the workshop.

      

    - **Block 2: Data Preprocessing**
      This block will guide you through downloading and preprocessing the dataset, including any image resizing, normalization, and splitting into training and test sets.

    - **Block 3: Model Architecture**
      In this block, you'll define the CNN model architecture using Keras and TensorFlow.

    - **Block 4: Training the Model**
      Here, you'll train the model on the training dataset and monitor the performance on the test set.

    - **Block 5: Evaluation and Results**
      Finally, you'll evaluate the model's performance and make predictions.

3. **Running the blocks**:
   Run each block in sequence by selecting the cell and pressing **Shift+Enter**.

   Make sure to read the instructions in each block carefully, as they'll walk you through each part of the process.

4. **Additional Resources**:
    - [TensorFlow Documentation](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
    - [Keras Documentation](https://keras.io/)
